# Auto_Insurance_Fraud_Detection

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that effectively identifies auto insurance fraud cases. The rarity of such fraudulent claims presents a significant challenge, yet the potential for a precise model to considerably diminish financial losses for insurance companies is considerable.

This research focuses on accurately identifying fraudulent insurance claims without delving into the specifics of the fraud types. To achieve this, various classification algorithms are utilized, such as Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees.
