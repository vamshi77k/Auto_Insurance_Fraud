# Auto_Insurance_Fraud_Detection

The project's primary objective is to create a machine learning model capable of detecting instances of auto insurance fraud. This task is inherently challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of fraudulent claims. Nevertheless, a highly accurate model can have a substantial impact on reducing financial losses for insurance companies.

The study places its emphasis on classifying fraudulent insurance claims without the need for detailed knowledge about the specific types of fraud involved. To accomplish this, several classification algorithms have been employed, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees.
